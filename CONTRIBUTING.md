# How to contribute

First of all, I would like to thank you for taking your time to help us develop this app. We are really glad you're here !.

This are some resources and knowledge you need to start:
  * [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.io/docs)
  * [Dart Documentation](https://www.dartlang.org/)
  * [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/)

## What to do

Search in our [Projects](https://github.com/stevencode5/RuthApp/projects) where we have some issues and features that you can solve. If you have an idea or a bug not reported yet, create an [Issue](https://github.com/stevencode5/RuthApp/issues/) with the information required. Always follow the templates (Bug, Feature and Pull Request).


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to RuthApp](https://github.com/stevencode5/RuthApp/pull/new/master), complete the default list with clear information of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, include examples and test of the issue o feature you solved. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it:

This projectâ€™s code follows the conventions in the [Dart style guide](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart/style).

Thanks,
RuthApp's development group.
